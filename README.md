PCF8574AP I/O Board Expansion Chip Code

Written for Arudino

The PCF8574AP is a very useful chip for many projects. It can be used to exapand the number of input or output pins on a microcontroller.

I commonly use these chips to run 7-segment displays or to gather data froma controller with multiple buttons.
